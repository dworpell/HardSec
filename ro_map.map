Mapping design into LUTs...
Running directed packing...
WARNING:Pack:2515 - The LUT-1 inverter
   "Mcompar_puf_out_cmp_gt0000_cy<5>_inv1_INV_0" failed to join the OLOGIC comp
   matched to output buffer "puf_out_OBUF".  This may result in suboptimal
   timing.  The LUT-1 inverter Mcompar_puf_out_cmp_gt0000_cy<5>_inv1_INV_0
   drives multiple loads.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
